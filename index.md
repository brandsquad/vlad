## Salut! Oi! Hola! Hi!

I write stuff, mostly css these days.

### What am I doing right **now**:

- Looking over a jungle of green from a coffee spot in Ubud, Bali with a fan blasting in my face
- Realised I had not posted monthly updates under the [then](/then) section, it's just been updated ;)
- Visited [The Venerable Thich Quảng Đức Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c), The War Remnants Museum and some pagodas in Ho Chi Minh before I left for Bali
- Spent the first few days in Indonesia meeting locals and getting used to the new sounds and flavours around me, now settled in Ubud for the rest of the week
- Followed friends' recommandations (thanks Andra, Răzvan), gathered some of my own and scheduled the next few days to leisurely enjoy Ubud and surroundings
- Missing Vietnam a bit 🤫
