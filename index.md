## Salut! Oi! Hola! Hi!

I write stuff, mostly code.

### What am I doing right **now**:

- Walking barefoot on the seaside, north of Venice in a small summer village
- Had a short 3 days holiday in Venice at the beginning of September, and scheduling another one on the 21st
- Viewed some movies on a [floating cinema](https://www.cinemagalleggiante.it/)
- Went on a short hike in the Dolomiti (hello Claudia), saw the beautiful [Lake Sorapis](https://www.google.com/search?q=sorapis+lake&tbm=isch)
- Took a short trip to Verona, and viewed quirky bars and pubs in Padova
- Moved to a place where I'm probably the only inhabitant in the building (it's really nice to be in a summer village towards the end of the season, eerily quiet and tranquil)
- Finished some big projects, took on some bigger ones and trying to stay on track - probably the rain announced towards the end of the month will help with that
- Planned a short trip to Bucharest and Piatra NeamÈ› in mid-October, whilst my winter plans got a bit sidetracked
