## Salut! Oi! Hola! Hi!

I write stuff, mostly javascript these days.

### What am I doing right **now**:

- Enjoying the A/C at [Space A](https://spacea-danang.com/coworking-space-in-danang/) coworking in Da Nanag, Vietnam
- Got reminded days on end for the past 3 weeks that I took on too many projects and some deadlines moved backwards in time which added more pressure, pressure that's forcing me to do even more, which for the short term is ok (btw, I'm looking for a [front-end developer collaborator](https://websquad.ro/collaborator.html)), but I will take a longer break in the near future
- So far in SouthEast Asia I stayed 4 days in Singapore - hostels are not the best place to adjust on a different timezone and recover on sleep, learned that the hard way - after that a week in Kuala Lumpur and this is my third and last week in Da Nanag, on friday I'll land in Ho Chi Minh (Saigon) and stay there for the rest of my visa in Vietnam; not sure where next, maybe Thailand, maybe Indonesia
- Besides work I managed to fully enjoy the food here, and no matter how many documentaries you watch about asian food, until you taste it, you are so far from it
- Got to see a few buddhist and hindu temples, truly felt the zen at [ChÃ¹a Linh á»¨ng](https://goo.gl/maps/DKvrnEJptf5cdX2XA)
- Last weekend I rented a motorbike and managed to navigate the traffic here, or I might have been lucky at the hours I've ridden; nonetheless I managed to join a group on Sunday (hello [Bamboo Bob](https://bamboo-bob.com/)) and we visited some [abandoned resorts](https://wanderingasianguy.com/2013/12/13/no-vacancies-abandoned-resorts-and-projects-in-da-nang-vietnam/) (add some extra vegetation, but these places are still here, still abandoned), a secret beach and we had a full day of adventures on the [Háº£i VÃ¢n Pass](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/H%E1%BA%A3i_V%C3%A2n_Pass)
- These days I'm saying the regular "see you soon" to the people I've met here and packing for Hue and then Saigon
