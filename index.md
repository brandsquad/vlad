## Salut!

My name is Vlad and I write stuff, mostly code.

What am I doing right **now**:

- Replying to emails unread from January
- Integrating feedback from the last event into the [Acacia](https://acacia.events/) platform
- Managed to unwind a bit in an AirBnb, acknowledged I need way more time off
- Reading Jung: The Key Ideas by Ruth Snowden
- Re-evaluating routines
