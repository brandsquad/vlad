## Salut!

My name is Vlad and I write stuff, mostly code.

What am I doing right **now**:

- Replying to emails unread from ~~January~~ February
- Testing out [the Ivy Lee method](https://jamesclear.com/ivy-lee): 6 tasks set the day before, only focus on one at a time
- Reading Dictionary of the impossible by Didier Van Cauwelaert and Bodies by Susie Orbach
- Regaining my pre-winter strenght
- Wondering where should I move and planning for a spring vacation or staycation (depends on lockdown status)

[How are you](mailto:vlad@wow.com?subject=Hey%2C%20I'm%20doing...)?
