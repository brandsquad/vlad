## Salut! Oi! Hola! Hi!

I write stuff, mostly code.

### What am I doing right **now**:

- Arrived in Madrid on July 1st after some *adventures* (do not enter the M30 tunnel if you only have GPS, or at least count the km and memorize the exit before you enter)
- Adjusting to the temperature (from 19-22°C in Porto to 35-39°C here) by having cold showers and going to the pool
- Found some interesting books in [the place I stay](https://www.bravojoana.com/), one of them: Rainer Maria Rilke - Letters to a Young Poet; besides that I finished reading Ușa Interzisă (The Forbidden Door) by Gabriel Liiceanu and started cleaning/reading the bookmarks tagged 'to read'
- Wrote some updates on [may](/then/2022-05.html) and [june](/then/2022-06.html) (I really took the holiday seriously)
- Getting ready to greet all the people that have plans to visit Madrid this month, this is truly a social city

[How are you](mailto:vlad@nsu.ro?subject=Hey%2C%20I%20am%20...)?
