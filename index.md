## Salut!

My name is Vlad and I write stuff, mostly code.

What am I doing right **now**:

- Replying to emails unread from ~~January~~ February
- Testing out [the Ivy Lee method](https://jamesclear.com/ivy-lee): 6 tasks set the day before, only focus on one at a time
- Reading Dictionary of the impossible by Didier Van Cauwelaert
- Rebuilding my exercise routine lost in the lazy winter
- Wondering if I'm moving too slow, in general
