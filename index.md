## Hello, Â¡Hola, Salut

My name is Vlad and I write stuff, mostly code.

What am I doing right **now**:

- On the final stretch to launch some of the biggest projects of this year, waiting for a well-deserved holiday
- Reading Asimov's Foundation series (Foundation's Edge) and some Nora Iuga books
- Writing lots of sort-of-poetry lyrics and working on a way to share them outside [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17905292686480013/)
