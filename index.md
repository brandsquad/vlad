## Salut!

My name is Vlad and I write stuff, mostly code.

What am I doing right **now**:

- Scheduling projects for the following weeks and months
- Getting ready for a big launch at the end of January with the [Acacia](https://acacia.events/) platform
- Had a few days of relaxation between Christmas and the first monday of [12021](https://shop-eu.kurzgesagt.org/products/12-021-human-era-calendar?variant=33326590263384)
- Reading Asimov's Foundation series and Dostoievski's Demons
- Keeping an exercise routine started in October, building other routines
