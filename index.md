Growing #2 - Do now
-

You can only **do** things right now.

"The time is now" as Moloko's Róisín sings. What you eat, drink, watch, type, read now, how much you sleep now, it all compounds to who you are, now and later. And maybe you don't like a certain element of you now - you watch too much crap, eat too much fast food, read the news. But you can stop right now, and do the things that you know are right for you.

What's been done is in the past, what will come, will have to wait.


Growing #1 - Face yourself
-

We all strive to become better at who we are, at what we do. Or we should try.
Some know what to do in order to get there. But don't realise it.

Every time you have an intent of doing something you think is right, a voice inside stops you. And that's your voice; you are your greatest enemy.

To overcome yourself you must know yourself.
"Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced." - James Baldwin.

So face yourself, find out who you truly are and who you want to become.
And make a conscious effort to transform who you want to be into who you are.
