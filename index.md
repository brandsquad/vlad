## Salut! Oi! Hola! Hi!

I write stuff, mostly css.

### What am I doing right **now**:

- Watching the sunset in Meteora, Greece
- 'Enjoying' the last few days of a long, long trip that started on October 10th with: one week in Bucharest, one week in Piatra NeamÈ›, and this week driving from Treviso, Italy to Bansko, Bulgaria (taking the ferry from Brindisi to Igoumenitsa)
- Visited one too many cities, but still managed to enjoy the journey while refraining from yelling at all the italian drivers
- A lot has been going on during this trip, but haven't managed to stop and reflect about any of it, so I'm glad I'll have a base in the next few months and get back to the inside journey I feel I've been postponing for a while
- Started reading Dostoevsky's "The House of the Dead" - a semi-autobiographical (not for the faint of heart) novel
- Listened to quite a lot of Huberman and Friedman podcast episodes
