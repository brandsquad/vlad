## Salut!

My name is Vlad and I write stuff, mostly code.

What am I doing right **now**:

- Changing daily priorities (as Stephen Colbert said at Webby's in 2008: [ME ME ME ME ME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzfksyBjYpc))
- Reading Asimov's Prelude to Foundation
- Fixing my sleep pattern
- [The Ivy Lee method](https://jamesclear.com/ivy-lee) worked out, however I noticed I'm more productive in short, intenstive sprints, not sure how routine-able are they though ðŸ¤”
- Wondering ~~where~~ why should I move and planning for a spring vacation or staycation (depends on lockdown status)

[How are you](mailto:vlad@wow.com?subject=Hey%2C%20I'm%20doing...)?
