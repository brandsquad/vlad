## Hello, Â¡Hola, Salut

My name is Vlad and I write stuff, mostly code.

What am I doing right **now**:

- On the final stretch to launch the biggest project of the year, [sneak peek](https://acacia.events)
- Had a great (and intense) time with Tehnic Media on their [Demo Metal online event](https://demometal.ro/virtual/final-demo-metal-virtual-2020/)
- Launched some big projects with [D&A](https://danielandandrew.com/) and [Toast Media](https://toastmedia.co.uk/) - links are [here](https://nsu.ro/other-services/)
- (Still) Planning a well-deserved staycation -\_- (Christmas maybe? Fingers crossed)
- Reading Hawking's A Brief History of Time
- Writing some more [poe stuff](/poe/)
