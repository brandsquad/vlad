## What was I doing in June 2022

<sub><sup>Stuff I did that I didn't write about in the updates:</sup></sub>
- Enjoyed a well deserved two week holiday, most of it far from the computer
- Went to WordCamp Europe 2022, met one amazing person in particular (hi, Ohia)
- Moved in with some amazing flatmates and their dog, listened to incredible stories at noon coffees
- Went to pub quizes, won two times (last and first places) üçª
- Saw Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds, Grimes and Gorillaz at Primavera Sound - my first festival
- Ate the real [francesinha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesinha) - twice (in different weeks)
- Had fun at Porto Beer Fest
- Enjoyed the ocean as much as I could
- Realized how much I missed the rain
- Booked the whole winter in a ski resort
- Did an 18 hour round-trip to Lisbon to party once more with the friends I made there
