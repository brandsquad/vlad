## What was I doing in December 2022

- Riding the train from my parent's place to Bucharest, then heading back to Bansko
- Having some quiet holidays with friends and family, and receiving greetings from all the awesome people I met this and last year
- Thoroughly enjoyed traditional food at home
- Finished the year with lots of delivered projects, might have a proper portfolio page at some point
- Getting ready to test the only open slope in Bansko
- Still playing with my sleeping schedule, keeping up with cold showers every now and then and noticing how coffee usage is going down (sorry, [Origo](https://origocoffee.ro/))

<sub><sup>Stuff I did that I didn't write about in the updates:</sup></sub>
- Got back to Bansko after Christmas and had a proper holiday with two days of snowboarding, two days of hot baths and hikes, sprinkled with dinners and parties in between
- Really grateful and amazed by the nomad community in Bansko, definitely a place I'll get back to
