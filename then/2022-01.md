## What was I doing in January 2022

- Working a bit too much, but managed to finally [have a website](https://websquad.ro/)
- Planning a trip back home for February
- Reconsidering future surf attempts after a bad muscle cramp at my first and only lesson (kayaking looks more pleasant)
- Going strong with cold showers or cold exposure every other day
- ~~- Planning and attending meetup events to get to know people around Lisbon~~ (staying safe)
- Sketching some year-long travel plans but also preparing to drop them altogether
- Got my [WordCamp Europe](https://europe.wordcamp.org/2022/) tickets, see you in Porto!
