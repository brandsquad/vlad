## What was I doing in November 2022

- Cooked myself a nice, simple meal on this lazy sunday
- Went a bit overboard with socializing these weeks, but it's incredible how many foreigners are in Bansko (as well as coworking spaces)
- Picking the events I want to go to this next week and planning a short trip to Veliko Tarnovo next weekend 
- Pondering about building a personal image gallery or using something from the [fediverse](https://fediverse.party/); any other suggestions?
- Managed to get on track with most work projects and still a lot to deliver, but got a wave of new ideas to build something from scratch
- Read and watched "Childhood's End" - _devilshly_ awesome SF novel by Arthur C. Clarke, and started reading "Quantum Man: Richard Feynman's Life in Science" by Lawrence M. Krauss
- Also got a bit on track with some TV Series and enjoying the hikes around here
- Updated the DOR link on the [NOtifications list of links](/article/notifications.html)

<sub><sup>Stuff I did that I didn't write about in the updates:</sup></sub>
- Attended lots of social events in Bansko
- Went on two hikes in the Pirin mountains
- Tried yoga with an instructor and added some moves to my routines
