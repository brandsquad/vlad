## What I was doing in July 2022

- Arrived in Madrid on July 1st after some *adventures* (do not enter the M30 tunnel if you only have GPS, or at least count the km and memorize the exit before you enter)
- Adjusting to the temperature (from 19-22°C in Porto to 35-39°C here) by having cold showers and going to the pool
- Found some interesting books in [the place I stay](https://www.bravojoana.com/), one of them: Rainer Maria Rilke - Letters to a Young Poet; besides that I finished reading Ușa Interzisă (The Forbidden Door) by Gabriel Liiceanu and started cleaning/reading the bookmarks tagged 'to read'
- Wrote some updates on [may](/then/2022-05.html) and [june](/then/2022-06.html) (I really took the holiday seriously)
- Getting ready to greet all the people that have plans to visit Madrid this month, this is truly a social city
- Handling quite well the way-above-average temperatures for July in Madrid (~39°C, with some consecutive days of +40°C)
- Went for up to 3 cold showers per day
- Finished some older tasks and smaller projects, and replaced one of the VPS providers
- Got a bit into Shopify theme building, but the new online code editor is below reproach
- Dropped meat consumption to a minimum, lo siento, jamon iberico
- Had some fun at San Juan Reservoir (Pantano de San Juan) in a weekend, went kayaking on the lake
