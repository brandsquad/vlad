## What was I doing in May 2022

- Started packing for Porto, enjoying the last week in Lisbon with old and new friends
- Back to the coworking place, managed to book the whole week in the same location
- Launching some projects I've been working on in the past two months, one of them: [Antiseismic District](https://antiseismic.info)
- Started reading "No! The Power of Disagreement in a World that Wants to Get Along" by Charlan Nemeth

<sub><sup>Stuff I did that I didn't write about in the updates:</sup></sub>
- Optimized the Spaces coworking days to the max
- Arrived in Porto unscathed
