## What was I doing in October 2022

- Reading an essay called ["Herding Cats and Free Will Inflation" by Daniel C. Dennet](https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2021/03/daniel-c-dennett-herding-cats-and-free-will-inflation.html) while having a good coffee watching [falling leaves](https://falseknees.tumblr.com/post/696679242182819840/prints-in-store)
- planned a new route towards my next destination, Bansko
- getting ready for a two week trip to Romania for family events and meeting friends
- started tracking sleep times and other data, what I will do with that information remains to be seen
- found some new music to listen to: Findlay, Foxtrott, Mitski
- Watching the sunset in Meteora, Greece
- 'Enjoying' the last few days of a long, long trip that started on October 10th with: one week in Bucharest, one week in Piatra Neam»õ, and this week driving from Treviso, Italy to Bansko, Bulgaria (taking the ferry from Brindisi to Igoumenitsa)
- Visited one too many cities, but still managed to enjoy the journey while refraining from yelling at all the italian drivers
- A lot has been going on during this trip, but haven't managed to stop and reflect about any of it, so I'm glad I'll have a base in the next few months and get back to the inside journey I feel I've been postponing for a while
- Started reading Dostoevsky's "The House of the Dead" - a semi-autobiographical (not for the faint of heart) novel
- Listened to quite a lot of Huberman and Friedman podcast episodes
