## What was I doing in February 2022

- Getting a hold on working while traveling and avoiding covid to the max (4 cities in < two weeks, tested negative all the way)
- Managed to gather a list of articles and a video about [web3](/article/web3.html)

Some thoughts after 4100km in 9 days (driving 6-7 hours per day, except days 6 and 8):
- Slovenia has the roads with the best views
- If an event (cough, cough, Carnaval) affects your schedule in any way, there is definitely a reason for it - I was unable to book a hotel in the center of Madrid due to high demand, but later realised I would have been unable to drive my car there, in the low emissions zone
- Best gas prices are in small cities and definitely not on italian highways
- It's better to get a hotel or airbnb further from the center but with parking than to struggle finding parking spots, moreso if you have a lot of stuff in the car
- Spain is bigger than what it looks like on the map
- A8 in France, right after entering from Italy has the smoothest asphalt ever
