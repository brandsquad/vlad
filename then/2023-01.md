## What was I doing in January 2023

- Catching up with friends over coffees, dinners and drinks in Bucharest, sometimes all at once
- Getting back to work has been a bit hectic, not sure if the vibe in the big city has anything to do with that, I'll see how I feel next month
- Going through some year old newsletters (hehe) and tidying up bookmarks and lists (movies to watch, music to listen to)
- Organizing and re-organizing my stuff, figuring out what I really need so I can get rid of the rest
- Realising I can make myself feel at home pretty much anywhere in a few days - this will come in handy over the next few months
- Found a **neat place** to upload photos: [Glass.photo](https://glass.photo/nvm)

<sub><sup>Stuff I did that I didn't write about in the updates:</sup></sub>
- Went hiking on a snow covered peak in Bansko, climbed to >2600m on Bezbog Peak in the Pirin Mountains
- Had a cold bath in a river on the 2nd of January, then kept having cold showers for the rest of the month
- Traveled back to Romania and moved between Bucharest and Piatra Neamț, celebrating time and events with friends and family
- Meeting old friends and getting to know new people, went to concerts and walks in the snow, and watched The Last of Us
