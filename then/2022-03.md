## What I was doing in march 2022

- After I filled the first two weeks of March with mind battles against myself, during which I neglected my needs of rest, eat and the work schedule, I am taking a break from non essential tasks and working on getting back on track
- Got a coworking membership at Spaces, first week looks promising
- Read a new article on [web3](/article/web3.html) by [Scott Galloway](https://www.profgalloway.com/web3/)

<sub><sup>Stuff I did that I didn't write about in the updates:</sup></sub>
- Went to a poetry event where I recited one
- Visited a really nice botanical garden inside a park in Lisbon
- Witnessed a two day dust storm above the city, the sky was incredible
