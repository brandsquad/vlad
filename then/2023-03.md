## What was I doing in March 2023

<sub><sup>Stuff I did that I didn't write about in the updates:</sup></sub>
- Went on a monasteries tour with my mom
- Short weekend visit to Iași to catch up with friends and family
- Saying temporary goodbyes to old friends in Bucharest
- Went indoor climbing, managed to do 3 easy courses in Bucharest
- Landed in Singapore and hit by jet lag big time, yet I had no idea
- Managed to stay in two hostels in Singapore half-awake, half-asleep for about 4 days, met long time friends (hello, Claudia)
- Landed in Kuala Lumpur and started a week long rest (scattered with work here and there and everywhere), zombieing between the hotel room, pool, gym and breakfast + dinner places
- Visited the Batu Caves and climbed all the 272 steps
- Got major science-fiction vibes (hello HIMYM fans) at 5:48am, being woken up by beautiful prayers among the mosques scattered between the skyscrapers ([Merdeka 118](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merdeka_118), the second largest structure and building in the world, will open in June 2023) in Kuala Lumpur
