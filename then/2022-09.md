## What I was doing in September 2022

- Walking barefoot on the seaside, north of Venice in a small summer village
- Had a short 3 days holiday in Venice at the beginning of September, and scheduling another one on the 21st
- Viewed some movies on a [floating cinema](https://www.cinemagalleggiante.it/)
- Went on a short hike in the Dolomiti (hello Claudia), saw the beautiful [Lake Sorapis](https://www.google.com/search?q=sorapis+lake&tbm=isch)
- Took a short trip to Verona, and viewed quirky bars and pubs in Padova
- Moved to a place where I'm probably the only inhabitant in the building (it's really nice to be in a summer village towards the end of the season, eerily quiet and tranquil)
- Finished some big projects, took on some bigger ones and trying to stay on track - probably the rain announced towards the end of the month will help with that
- Planned a short trip to Bucharest and Piatra Neam»õ in mid-October, whilst my winter plans got a bit sidetracked

<sub><sup>Stuff I did that I didn't write about in the updates:</sup></sub>
- 3 more days in Venice for the Bienalle, which was an incredible experience
- friends visiting at the seaside
- started using a new book tracking app: [Hardcover](https://hardcover.app/@vlad)
- got back to watching TV Shows as rewards for work, some evening spanning out of control, but managed to get a hold on it (or so I lie to myself)
