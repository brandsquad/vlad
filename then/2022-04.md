## What I was doing in April 2022

<sub><sup>Stuff I did that I didn't write about in the updates:</sup></sub>
- Learned about less visited places close to the ocean cost
- Weekend in Madrid (never taking the bus for routes longer than 5 hours)
- Visited new cafes and restaurants in Rato, Lisbon
- Got a full week holiday, 4 days in Seville, and the weekend showing new friends places I discovered around Lisbon
