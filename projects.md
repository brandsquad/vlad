Projects
--------

The work for these projects consisted of writing code: html, css, javascript and mostly php, as well as launching the site. For most of the projects the template has been coded from scratch, if not specified otherwise in the description.
<br/>I also manage the hosting and maintenance work for some of these sites through [nsu.ro](https://nsu.ro).
